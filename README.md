# Fair Dice VRF - dcipher Network

Verifiable Randomness Function (VRF) in action on dice game using **dcipher Network's threshold cryptography**. This simple implementation showcases how distributed trust eliminates single points of failure in random number generation.

## Features

- 🎲 **Cryptographically Fair**: Uses dcipher's threshold network for tamper-proof randomness
- ⚖️ **No Modulo Bias**: Implements rejection sampling for perfectly fair dice distribution
- 🔍 **Publicly Verifiable**: Anyone can verify randomness through threshold cryptographic proofs
- 🌐 **Distributed Trust**: No single party can manipulate the outcome
- ⚡ **Real-time**: Live connection to dcipher network

## Architecture

This implementation demonstrates the practical application of threshold cryptography concepts covered in the article "From Polynomials to Distributed Secrets: Understanding the Foundations of dcipher Network with Threshold Cryptography."

### Mathematical Foundation
- **Shamir Secret Sharing**: f(x) = secret + a₁x + a₂x² for distributed secrets
- **BLS Signatures**: Threshold-friendly signature aggregation
- **Lagrange Interpolation**: Reconstructing secrets from threshold shares
- **Rejection Sampling**: Eliminating modulo bias for fair outcomes

### dcipher Integration
- **Threshold Randomness**: Distributed VRF generation across multiple nodes
- **Committee Consensus**: Rotating committees ensure network resilience  
- **Cryptographic Proofs**: BLS threshold signatures provide verifiability
- **No Single Point of Failure**: Mathematical guarantees of fairness

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with ES6 module support
- Python 3.x or Node.js (for local server)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vrf_fd
   ```

2. **Install dependencies (optional: if you have python installed)**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start local server**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Using npm script
   npm run start
   
   # Option 2: Using Python (Recommended)
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Option 3: Using Node.js
   npx http-server -p 8000
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Threshold Randomness Generation
dcipher network generates randomness through threshold consensus

```javascript
const randomnessData = await fetchDcipherRandomness();
```

### 2. Fair Dice Conversion
Rejection sampling eliminates modulo bias

```javascript
const diceResult = avoidModuloBias(randomBytes, 6) + 1;
```

### 3. Cryptographic Verification
Verify threshold proofs and signatures

```javascript
const isValid = await verify(round, signature, thresholdProof, randomness);
```
