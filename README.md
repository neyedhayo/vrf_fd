# Fair Dice VRF - dcipher Network

Verifiable Randomness Function (VRF) in action on dice game using **dcipher Network's threshold cryptography**. This simple implementation showcases how distributed trust eliminates single points of failure in random number generation.

## Features

- üé≤ **Cryptographically Fair**: Uses dcipher's threshold network for tamper-proof randomness
- ‚öñÔ∏è **No Modulo Bias**: Implements rejection sampling for perfectly fair dice distribution
- üîç **Publicly Verifiable**: Anyone can verify randomness through threshold cryptographic proofs
- üåê **Distributed Trust**: No single party can manipulate the outcome
- ‚ö° **Real-time**: Live connection to dcipher network

## Architecture

This implementation demonstrates the practical application of threshold cryptography concepts covered in the article "From Polynomials to Distributed Secrets: Understanding the Foundations of dcipher Network with Threshold Cryptography."

### Mathematical Foundation
- **Shamir Secret Sharing**: f(x) = secret + a‚ÇÅx + a‚ÇÇx¬≤ for distributed secrets
- **BLS Signatures**: Threshold-friendly signature aggregation
- **Lagrange Interpolation**: Reconstructing secrets from threshold shares
- **Rejection Sampling**: Eliminating modulo bias for fair outcomes

### dcipher Integration
- **Threshold Randomness**: Distributed VRF generation across multiple nodes
- **Committee Consensus**: Rotating committees ensure network resilience  
- **Cryptographic Proofs**: BLS threshold signatures provide verifiability
- **No Single Point of Failure**: Mathematical guarantees of fairness

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with ES6 module support
- Python 3.x or Node.js (for local server)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vrf_fd
   ```

2. **Install dependencies (optional: if you have python installed)**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start local server**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Using npm script
   npm run start
   
   # Option 2: Using Python (Recommended)
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Option 3: Using Node.js
   npx http-server -p 8000
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

## üéØ How It Works

### 1. Threshold Randomness Generation
dcipher network generates randomness through threshold consensus

```javascript
const randomnessData = await fetchDcipherRandomness();
```

### 2. Fair Dice Conversion
Rejection sampling eliminates modulo bias

```javascript
const diceResult = avoidModuloBias(randomBytes, 6) + 1;
```

### 3. Cryptographic Verification
Verify threshold proofs and signatures

```javascript
const isValid = await verify(round, signature, thresholdProof, randomness);
```


## Usage

1. **Roll the Dice**: Click "Roll Fair Dice" to generate a cryptographically fair result
2. **View Details**: See the randomness hash, round number, and committee info
3. **Verify Result**: Click "Verify Randomness" to check cryptographic proofs

## Security Features

### Threshold Cryptography
- **Distributed Generation**: No single party can bias the outcome
- **Committee Rotation**: Dynamic node selection prevents collusion  
- **Cryptographic Proofs**: BLS signatures provide mathematical verification
- **Rejection Sampling**: Eliminates statistical bias in dice conversion

### Network Properties
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Continues operating with up to 1/3 malicious nodes
- **Public Verifiability**: Anyone can verify randomness independently
- **Tamper Evidence**: Any manipulation attempt is cryptographically detectable
